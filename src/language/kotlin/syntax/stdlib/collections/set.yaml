comment: Demonstrates how to work with immutable and mutable sets in Kotlin, covering creation, operations, and key methods.
description: |
  In Kotlin, a `Set` is a collection that contains unique elements and does not maintain a specific order. There are two types of sets:
  
  1. **Immutable Set**: Created using `setOf()`, the elements of an immutable set cannot be modified after its creation.
  2. **Mutable Set**: Created using `mutableSetOf()`, this type of set allows adding or removing elements.

  Common operations on sets include adding/removing elements, checking for membership, set operations (like union, intersection), and iterating over the elements.

example:
  - title: Creating an Immutable Set
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      // Creating an immutable set
      val numbers: Set<Int> = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
      println(numbers) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      ```
  
  - title: Creating a Mutable Set
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      // Creating a mutable set
      val mutableFruits = mutableSetOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
      mutableFruits.add("grape")
      println(mutableFruits) // Output: [apple, banana, orange, grape]
      ```

  - title: Checking for Element Existence
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      val colors = setOf("red", "green", "blue")
      println(colors.contains("green"))  // Output: true
      println("yellow" in colors)  // Output: false
      ```

  - title: Set Operations (Union, Intersection)
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      val setA = setOf(1, 2, 3)
      val setB = setOf(3, 4, 5)

      val unionSet = setA.union(setB)
      println(unionSet)  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

      val intersectionSet = setA.intersect(setB)
      println(intersectionSet)  // Output: [3]
      ```

  - title: Removing Elements from a Mutable Set
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      val mutableSet = mutableSetOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
      mutableSet.remove("banana")
      println(mutableSet)  // Output: [apple, cherry]
      ```

  - title: Iterating over a Set
    content: |
      ```kotlin
      val numbers = setOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
      for (num in numbers) {
          println(num)  // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
      }
      ```
